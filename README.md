# DSCI 235 Final Project
## Project Description
The video game of Pokemon is a video game about collecting and battling fictional creatures known as Pokemon. These video games have been coming out every few years since 1996 and with each entry into this beloved franchise comes a new generation of pokemon to catch and battle. With 8 generations out and 9th generation being announced, I began to wonder how diverse each pokemon generation is? In the world of Pokemon, each Pokemon has a type associated with it, and these types range from Water to Ghost to Fairy. In the datatset I have selected, it details all 908 pokemon from all 8 generations since the first game. Each pokemon in this dataset contains a pokedex number, the games have a type of encyclopedia for every pokemon, the type(s) it is, species, how effective it is against other typings and much more.

With all this information from the dataset I plan to answer the following questions in this notebook.

1. How many types are there for each generation of Pokemon?
    * How many Pokemon have dual typing (Pokemon with 2 typings) are there?
2. Understand how these Pokemon types change with each generation?
    * What type had the biggest increase in each generation?
3. What Pokemon type is the most common in each generation and overall?
