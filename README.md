# DSCI235-Final
## Final Project for DSCI 235
My idea for this project is to take a deeper and more broaden look at Pokémon and how their types have changed over each game/generation that comes out. I want to start by seeing which types have had more or less Pokémon created and how many combined types have been created for each generation? How have these types changed over time and what is the most created Pokémon type in each generation of the games. So, in summary I would like to 

1. How many types and type combinations are there for each generation? 

2. Understand how these Pokémon types change with each generation? 

3. See which Pokémon type is the most common? 

The Dataset I will be using to understand these questions is this dataset [here](https://github.com/shahinrostami/pokemon_dataset/blob/master/pokemon_gen_1_to_8.csv).

I will be sifting through this dataset that contains every Pokémon including different forms (i.e., Alolan Form and Kanto Form), it contains every Pokémon of all 8 mainline games, which means that it includes 8 generations of Pokémon. It has them put in Pokedex order which is an order that games have for all Pokémon which starts at Pokémon 0, Bulbasaur, and goes to Pokémon 890, Eternatus. This dataset contains the name for all Pokémon's, size, weight, typing and many more statistical facts about them. It uses the rows as different Pokémon and columns as the different facts about the Pokémon.  

What Interests You About It – I have always had a love for video games since before I could remember. One of the biggest video games that had an impact on me was Pokémon. I have always loved the games and have recently reignited my love for the topic through the release of the newest Pokémon games. Through this topic I will be able to understand Pokémon better and understand how it has evolved and changed since its origin in 1996.
